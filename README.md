# Sorting Algorithm Visualizer using Python and PyQT5
This project aims to implement a graphical sorting visualisers for various common sorting algorithms.
It will keep track of comparisons, reads and writes and the implementation should allow for easy addition of additional
sorting algorithms. It uses PyQT5 for the visual component.

## Dependencies (Python 3):  
**Pillow** - Image handling `pip3 install pillow`  
**PyQT5** - GUI library `pip install PyQt5`
